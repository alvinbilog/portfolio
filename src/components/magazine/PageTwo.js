        <p>
          I'm Alvin, looking for a position to kickstart my career in the field
          of Frontend Development. I shifted from technical job to web
          development. I've been interested in learning Frontend Development
          since the beginning of pandemic and took this chance to be more
          skilled and knowledgeable on this field, sacrificing my time, being
          jobless just to focus and invested money just to achieve this dream of
          mine.
